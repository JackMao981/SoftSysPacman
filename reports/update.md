##  Playable Pacman
by Jack Mao
#### Lower Bound
Pacman is now moveable. (hooray!!!) For my new MVP, I want to make it so that pacman is animated when it moves.

#### Goal
I don't really see myself creating the walls and boundries anytime soon, but I think I will be able to create foods/power ups for pacman and let him eat it. This will be my goal.


#### Reach
Make a map for Pacman to navigate in as well as enemies for Pacman to avoid/fight.

#### Learning Goals
I have graduated from using graphics.h to using sdl2. My goal remains the same: to write a playable Pacman. In the process, I want to learn more about the game-creation method using sdl as well as how to translate object oriented coding to functional programming, since many tutorials use C++ for SDL2 and classes, something that is not available in C.

#### Current work
I am trying to get sprites to work. I will be done with sprites when Pacman looks animated.
