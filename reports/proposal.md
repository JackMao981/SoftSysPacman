##  Playable Pacman
by Jack Mao
#### Lower Bound
In this project, I plan on creating Pacman using C, as the title suggests. The very minimum that I plan on doing, if the project turns out to be much harder than expected, is creating the walls and a movable Pacman.

#### Goal
Realistically, I plan on doing more than just creating the walls and a movable Pacman. I also want to create ghosts. I want the ghosts to intelligently try to find Pacman if he is in the vicinity, and if that is too difficult, move around in a predetermined pattern. Lastly, I want to create the interaction when Pacman eats his powerup pill.

#### Reach
If this project turns out to be super simple, I plan on implementing a loading screen, randomly generated level maps, Pacman music, and other silly interactions that may not be present in the original Pacman game.

#### Learning Goals
I want to learn how to work with simple graphics in C. As an avid gamer, I think creating a game sounds the most fun to me. As hinted by the title, my goal is to create a playable Pacman written in C.

#### Resources
Pacman isn't exactly a new idea, and there are many implementation of Pacman out there already. I found several implementations of it just by typing on Google. I want to refrain from looking at them at the moment because I don't want to copy their implementations. I do have questions for the teaching team. What libraries should I look into for Pacman, without looking at how Pacman is made?

#### First Steps
I don't plan on working in a team for this project. I want to start exploring what packages are good for making 2D pixelated games in C. To demonstrate that this is done, I will have created a simple window with something random drawn on it.
